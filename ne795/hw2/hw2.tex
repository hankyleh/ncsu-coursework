\maketitle

\section{} Show that 

\[
    I_\nu = ch\nu\psi_\nu.
\]


\section{}

Show that the equilibrium intensity is equal to

\[
    I_\nu = B_\nu = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}.
\]


\section{} Moments \dots

\section{} Derive the speed of radiation wave in vauum in the radiative transfer (RT) model defined by

\begin{itemize}
    \item The grey time-dependent $P_1$ equations
    \item The grey time-dependent $P_{1/3}$ equations
\end{itemize}



\section{} Derive the system of the time-dependent $P_1$ and MEB equations in multigroup form from the spectral $P_1$ and MEB equations given by \dots

Note that as part of this derivation you will need to define group opacities in the multigroup photon balance, first moment, and MEB equations.
